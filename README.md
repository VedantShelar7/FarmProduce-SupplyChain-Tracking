🌾 FarmProduce Supply Chain Tracking

Transparent | Traceable | Trustworthy Agriculture

This project is a simple web-based supply chain tracking system designed to ensure end-to-end traceability of farm produce—from farmers to distributors, retailers, and finally consumers. Each stakeholder has their own dashboard, enabling clear visibility of product status as it moves through the supply chain.

🚀 Features

✔ Farmer Dashboard
Add produce details, update harvest data, and send items to the distributor.

✔ Distributor Dashboard
View incoming produce, verify quality, and pass items to retailers.

✔ Retailer Dashboard
Receive items from distributors and make them available to consumers.

✔ Consumer Dashboard
Track the journey of produce using a tracking ID for transparency.

✔ Main Homepage
Entry point with links to all dashboards.

🌐 How It Works

Farmer adds produce information (type, date harvested, quantity, batch ID).

Distributor receives and verifies the batch, then updates status.

Retailer receives the produce and makes it available for purchase.

Consumer enters Tracking ID to see the full journey of the produce.

This ensure complete traceability and trust for all parties involved.
