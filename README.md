🌾 FarmProduce Supply Chain Tracking

Transparent | Traceable | Trustworthy Agriculture

This project is a simple web-based supply chain tracking system designed to ensure end-to-end traceability of farm produce—from farmers to distributors, retailers, and finally consumers. Each stakeholder has their own dashboard, enabling clear visibility of product status as it moves through the supply chain.
